# Dhart-Academy
This is a Spring MVC app for a dance academy in Perugia, Italy. It is a Work in Progress.

To build this project I have used Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MongoDB, Bootstrap 4.5

Note: the app won't run properly locally due to the need to hide database URI in the application.properties; the website will be live soon.
